### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Adarlan

As a fervent enthusiast of open-source technology and the vibrant DevOps culture, I am driven by a passion for learning, teaching, and advancing the realm of cloud-native infrastructure.

### Featured Projects

[__Kube Formation__](https://github.com/adarlan/kube-formation): A project designed to practice and understand the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) architecture by setting up a cluster using [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/). This project leverages [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) for Infrastructure-as-a-Service, [Packer](https://packer.io/) to create images for the cluster nodes, [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) to provision the cluster infrastructure, [Ansible](https://ansible.com/) to initialize and join the cluster nodes, and other tools.

[__Plankton__](https://github.com/adarlan/plankton): An open-source pipeline orchestration tool that leverages the power of containers to run each job within its own isolated environment. This project is written in Java and shows my abilities with programming, design patterns, containers, and software documentation, in addition to my creativity in implementing complex ideas into practical code solutions.

[__K8sLab__](https://github.com/adarlan/k8slab): A project intended for exploring with a local [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster bundled with popular open-source tools and example applications, simulating a real environment. Use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to set up a [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) (Kubernetes-in-Docker) cluster, applying Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations, enforcing resource quotas, and defining limit ranges. Additionally, enhance the cluster's capabilities by installing tools such as [Ingress-Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) for traffic routing, [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/cd/) for continuous deployment, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for metrics scraping, [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) for log aggregation, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) for dashboard visualization.
