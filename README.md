### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Adarlan

As a fervent enthusiast of open-source technology and the vibrant DevOps culture, I am driven by a passion for learning, teaching, and advancing the realm of cloud-native infrastructure. My journey as a DevOps Engineer has been marked by a commitment to embracing innovative solutions and fostering collaborative environments.

### Portfolio Projects

[Kube Formation](https://github.com/adarlan/kube-formation): A project designed to practice and understand the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) architecture by setting up a cluster using [Kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/). This project leverages [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) for Infrastructure-as-a-Service, [Packer](https://packer.io/) to create images for the cluster nodes, [Terraform](https://terraform.io/) to provision the cluster infrastructure, [Ansible](https://ansible.com/) to initialize and join the cluster nodes, and other tools.

[Plankton](https://github.com/adarlan/plankton): An open-source pipeline orchestration tool that leverages the power of containers to run each job within its own isolated environment. This project is written in Java and shows my abilities with programming, design patterns, containers, and software documentation, in addition to my creativity in implementing complex ideas into practical code solutions.

[K8sLab](https://github.com/adarlan/k8slab): A collection of IaC modules, CI/CD workflows, and other utilities designed to simplify the provisioning and management of Kubernetes clusters across different environments, including major cloud providers and local setups. It creates a ready-to-use Kubernetes platform bundled with popular open-source tools and example applications. This project exemplifies my proficiency in Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Argo CD, and other cutting-edge technologies, encapsulating best practices in Cloud Computing, Container Orchestration, Infrastructure-as-Code, and Continuous Integration/Delivery.
