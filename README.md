## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### [__EKS Lab__](https://github.com/adarlan/eks-lab)

An __Amazon EKS__ experimentation project, packed with open-source tools and example applications. It automates __Kubernetes__ cluster setup using __Terraform__ and __Helm__, integrating: __Amazon VPC__ for networking, __Amazon Route 53__ for DNS management, __Ingress-Nginx__ for traffic routing, and __Cert-Manager__ with __Letâ€™s Encrypt__ for automated TLS certificate issuance.

### [__EC2 Kube Formation__](https://github.com/adarlan/kube-formation)

A project for understanding the __Kubernetes__ architecture by setting up a cluster on __Amazon EC2__ instances. It uses: __Packer__ to create cluster node images, __Terraform__ to provision infrastructure, and __Ansible__ to initialize the cluster.

### [__Local K8s__](https://github.com/adarlan/k8slab)

A local __Kubernetes__ cluster for experimentation, simulating real-world environments. Uses __Terraform__ to set up a __KinD__ cluster, enforcing RBAC, resource quotas, and limit ranges. It also includes: __Ingress-Nginx__ for traffic routing, __Argo CD__ for continuous deployment, __Prometheus__ for metrics scraping, __Loki__ for log aggregation, and __Grafana__ for dashboard visualization.

### [__Plankton CI/CD__](https://github.com/adarlan/plankton)

A lightweight CI/CD tool that runs each job in its own isolated __Docker__ container. Built with __Java__.
